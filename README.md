# Udacity-data-analysis-P6


## Summary

This visualization hopes to ilustrate the delays occurred in a random sample of all the flights that took place in 1987. I have used a sample as a case study for the user to understand the potencial of map visualizations. 

## Design
First I started using only th us map, however I was told that the visualization was off and that there were some flights outside the us, so I decided to use the world map.
Once I was using the world map some people found difficult to easily see the flight patterns so i decided to implement the zoom feature.
During the capture of feedback a colleage found an error in the coordinates for the Guam airport. I corrected the issue in the data.
Finally I added the color coded feature to be able to distinguish the different delays.

## Feedback
One colleage saw easily an error in the data found the visualization helpful
There was some feedback that helped me shape the map and set the placing of the buttons where it is, because as we remeber the buttons created by d3 natively are positioned and formatted differently.
The rest of the feedback was positive.
